# PhD portfolio

Portfolio of compositions (scores and recordings) of my doctoral project 'The Design of Note-Based Algorithmic Systems Through the Use of Mental Models'.

Scores include all twelve _Cartographies_ (2017-2019), _and thereafter they shape us_ (2019), _adrift_ (2020), and _what holds them together_ (2020). Some of these compositions have recordings available in the audio subfolder, others only audio mock-ups.
